    <h1> Love Letter </h1>
    Love Letter is a game where your goal is to be the last player standing. Now already this worries me, as games that eliminate players early on tend to kill the fun for those who were eliminated while draggin on for the others. So the way the game works is every player takes turns playing one of two cards from their hand.
